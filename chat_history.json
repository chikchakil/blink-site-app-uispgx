I'll use `read_file_tree` to get a sense of the project's file organization.\n2.  **WebView Implementation**: I'll implement a WebView component to load your website within the app. This will likely involve modifying the main screen or creating a new screen specifically for the WebView.\n3.  **UI Enhancements**: I'll add a loading indicator to improve the user experience while the website is loading in the WebView.\n4.  **Navigation**: I'll ensure seamless navigation within the app, allowing users to easily access the WebView screen.\n5.  **Design**: I'll implement a light theme with a modern and clean design.\n\nHere's the design vision:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   A welcoming home screen with a clear indication that it will load your website.\n*   A dedicated screen featuring a WebView component to display your website.\n*   A loading indicator to provide visual feedback while the website is loading.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#007BFF` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#6C757D` (Gray)\n    *   Accent: `#FFC107` (Yellow)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E9ECEF` (Light gray)\n*   **Typography:** Modern, clean fonts that suit the app's style.\n\nNow, let's start by examining the project structure.\n\n"}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I have the file structure.

I've successfully implemented the changes to load your website in a WebView. Here's what I did:\n\n## Changes Made:\n\n### 1. **Updated Color Scheme** (`styles/commonStyles.ts`)\n   - Implemented the light theme with the specified colors:\n     - Background: `#F5F5F5`\n     - Text: `#333333`\n     - TextSecondary: `#666666`\n     - Primary: `#007BFF`\n     - Secondary: `#6C757D`\n     - Accent: `#FFC107`\n     - Card: `#FFFFFF`\n     - Highlight: `#E9ECEF`\n\n### 2. **Modified Home Screen** (both `index.tsx` and `index.ios.tsx`)\n   - Replaced the FlatList with modal demos with a WebView component\n   - The WebView loads your website: `https://saas-appointment-manager-beauty-businesses-i25icg96.sites.blink.new`\n   - Added a loading indicator with \"Loading...\" text that displays while the website is loading\n   - Enabled JavaScript and DOM storage for full website functionality\n   - Added proper error handling with console logging\n   - Android version includes top padding (48px) to avoid the notch\n   - iOS version includes the header with title \"Appointment Manager\"\n\n### 3. **Removed Dependencies**\n   - Removed the `modalDemos` array import (no longer needed)\n   - Removed the `DemoCard` component import (no longer needed)\n\nThe app now displays your website in a full-screen WebView with a clean loading experience. The WebView will handle all the website's functionality, including navigation, forms, and any interactive elements on your site."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-11-26T18:38:59Z"}]
